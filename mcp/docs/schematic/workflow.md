# Schematic workflow

Use this workflow without continuing to PCB work unless the user explicitly asks for it.

For local context missing from the netlist, use [schematic groups](groups.md): `get_schematic_groups` returns likely blocks and direct non-ground wire islands for the current page, or concatenated page-local results for the full schematic.

## Create or modify

1. Resolve the target schematic and functional page.
2. Open that page and read it with `get_schematic`. Set `get_full_schematic: true` to read all schematic pages instead.
3. Search only unknown parts with `component_search` and use explicit, resolved components. It searches the `lcsc` library by default. Call `library_list` when a public-library component is needed, then pass its alias or explicit public library UUID as `library_uuid`. Results with ambiguous pin names may have `preview_recommended: true` and a local PNG `preview_image_path`. Skip preview for one-pin components, ordinary two-pin resistors, simple inductors/ferrite beads and fuses, or components whose pin functions are already clear from their names. Do not spend tool calls or visual-analysis tokens on these checks without a concrete contradiction. Capacitors are not exempt: polarity cannot be reliably inferred from search metadata. For other parts with any blank, numeric or number-identical pin name (including mixed named/unnamed pins), inspect only the selected candidate, using its PNG or `preview_component({ part_uuid })`. Do not inspect every search result or repeat a completed review of the same `part_uuid`. Verify unresolved pin functions against the exact part datasheet before connecting them.
4. Apply related changes with `extract_circuit_on_current_page`. Prefer one coherent call per page; multiple calls are allowed when staged checking is safer.
   - Inspect the returned `sheetSpace`.
   - If less than `10%` remains, finish the current function and continue substantial independent work on another functional page.
5. Run `beautify_schematic_on_current_page`:
   - required after removal, replacement, or connection reassignment;
   - recommended after completing a new AI-generated page;
   - requires every component on the current page, grouped exactly once.
   - Keep `draw_block_box: false` unless the user wants Copilot-managed functional boxes and labels.
   - `auto_resize_page` defaults to `true`: shrink or grow a standard drawing sheet to the smallest fitting format (A4–A0), leaving room for its border and title block. Custom or inconsistent drawing sheets retain their size. Set it to `false` to keep the current sheet size.
6. Follow [schematic verification](verification.md); reread the page when exact connectivity readback is needed.
7. Report the affected page and stop at the schematic boundary.

Beautify creates a checkpoint and restores it automatically if destructive page replacement fails. A successful beautify still changes the visual placement of the entire page. Warn the user first when preserving a manually arranged page matters.

## Beautify only

1. Read the current page.
2. Group all components by completed electrical function.
3. Call beautify once.
4. Apply [schematic verification](verification.md) to current-page readback.
5. If verification proves the result electrically incomplete or wrong and a safe revision is unavailable, restore it. For a purely aesthetic preference, keep, revise, or restore according to the user's stated preference.
