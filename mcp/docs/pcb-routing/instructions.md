# PCB layer count, rules, copper, and routing

Use `run_pcb_router_dsl` after opening the exact target EasyEDA PCB. Read the local [dsl.ts](dsl.ts) as the LLM syntax reference. The router package has a separate reference, intentionally maintained independently; use the path reported by the tool when diagnosing an unsupported method or version mismatch. Do not invent helpers. Dimensions in this DSL are millimeters; routing layers are `TOP`, `BOTTOM`, and `INNER_n`. `preview_pcb` also uses uppercase layer names such as `TOP` and `BOTTOM`; its special all-layer selector is lowercase `all`. Placement DSL layer names use lowercase `top`/`bottom`.

Each file is JavaScript statements with exactly one terminal call. Write it to an absolute path on the MCP host, then pass that path as `file`. Do not put TypeScript declarations, imports, shell commands, or KRT CLI flags in the file.

Use the DSL for the routing plan and scoped repairs. For a precise native edit or a missing feature, such as a copper keepout, follow the [native API edit workflow](../execution/instructions.md). Use it when DSL attempts cannot resolve a diagnosed problem or when the local edit is clearly simpler to express directly. Check the result with [routing verification](verification.md).

Before local geometric repairs, choose the execution path: use `execute_js` for a self-contained native edit; prefer the [local SDK](../execution/local-sdk.md#when-to-use-the-sdk) when Python/Node.js calculations, Shapely geometry or repeated read–calculate–apply cycles are involved. Keep board readback, local computation and scoped writes in one SDK script, then refill and verify the affected copper. Switch to this path when local calculations become necessary even if the routing task started with MCP calls. The SDK provides native API access; it does not replace the routing engine or automatically enforce routing constraints.

This workflow may start from an existing placement, but placement and routing are one coupled physical problem. Before full routing, verify that the placement offers plausible critical-signal, power, return, dense-package escape, via, and thermal paths under the intended stack. A routing-only request does not authorize moving components: when placement is the root cause, report the exact bottleneck or return to the placement workflow only when the requested scope allows it. Do not conceal a bad placement with repeated routing attempts.

## Plan globally, route in manageable transactions

For new or full-board routing, plan the complete board before splitting work. Establish:

- copper-layer structure;
- fabrication and DRC limits;
- power-net currents;
- controlled impedance and length/skew requirements when verified physical data exists;
- planes, required polygons, and required via stitching;
- routing scope, net importance, and via preferences.

For a simple single-sided or two-layer board with low placement density and ample routing space, try routing the whole board in one `run_pcb_router_dsl` call with `runAll()`, including the complete net plan, rules and required routing intent. Ground uses pours by default even in this single-call strategy: exclude ordinary ground nets from track routing with `ignoreNets(...)` while declaring their required polygons or planes. Handle any critical ground segment explicitly as described below; full-board intent does not mean routing every GND connection with tracks. Respect the intended routing layers; single-sided routing does not require an unsupported one-layer EasyEDA stack. If the attempt fails verification, leaves unrouted connections or stalls, switch to the scoped transaction workflow below instead of repeating the same full-board attempt.

Plan critical routes and their return paths together. The following is a **recommended starting sequence** for scoped transactions. Adapt, combine or reorder passes to suit the board's topology, stack, return paths, existing copper and observed routing results. Ordinary ground connections are provided by pours and checked afterward; an incremental task may need only a local repair. Choose the sequence that satisfies the actual design requirements.

```text
Suggested order (adapt to the board):
CRITICAL CIRCUITS AND RETURNS -> ORDINARY CIRCUITS -> POUR/STITCHING -> GROUND CHECK AND REPAIR -> FINAL CHECKS
```

1. **Critical circuits.** Usually begin with power paths, differential pairs, controlled-impedance signals, length-matched groups, crystal/resonator and clock connections, RF paths and sensitive analog/feedback circuits. Critical means that current capacity, coupling, impedance, timing, noise or local loop geometry constrains the route. Give these requirements priority when choosing and evaluating the routing strategy.
2. **Ordinary circuits.** Route the remaining signal and power connections while preserving critical copper and planned ground-pour space. Exclude ordinary ground nets from track routing; a critical return segment is handled with its critical circuit, not by raising the priority of the entire GND net.
3. **Pour and stitching.** Generate the chosen ground pours and useful stitching. Earlier reference copper can remain or be created when critical routing needs it.
4. **Ground check and repair.** Rebuild and inspect the actual fill and check connectivity. For required pads or islands that remain disconnected, first try a local pour correction or necessary ground vias. Route remaining ground connections with tracks only where the pour cannot provide the required connection, then refill and recheck.
5. **Final checks.** Verify whole-board connectivity, actual filled copper, critical constraints and native DRC. Recheck affected critical routes after any later repair.

Each transaction is one DSL file and one `run_pcb_router_dsl` call with exactly one terminal. `runAll()` applies the intent declared in that transaction; it does not require routing the entire board in one call. Split transactions when stage boundaries help control scope or inspect progress; combine work when the board permits it. When a particular order matters, express it through scoped calls; `priority` alone does not guarantee that order across the whole board.

Use `onlyNets(...)` for a selected group or `ignoreNets(...)` for nets deliberately deferred to another stage. Keep both legs of a differential pair, every member of a length-matched group and the relevant segments of a constrained logical path together. Include the rules and physical stack data needed by each transaction; do not assume that an earlier call persisted the full physical stack.

Smaller transactions are a normal option when they make progress easier to inspect or a large attempt is too slow or unsuccessful. Reduce the next scope to a functional group or the remaining problem nets instead of repeatedly submitting the same large job. Preserve successful copper, but account for it as a fixed obstacle in later calls; use scoped `clearRouting(...)` when a diagnosed blocker must be replaced. The router still performs its own internal stages within each call.

While `status: "running"`, call `wait_operation`. Its `progress.log_tail`, when available, shows recent router activity, including stage or remaining connections when the engine reports them. Follow [operation results](../operations.md) to interpret progress and terminal results. If abandoning a large attempt to split it, use `cancel_operation` and establish that it has finished before starting another mutation on that PCB. Inspect any applied partial result before choosing the next scope. Do not run competing routing transactions in parallel.

## Ground: pour first, route only where needed

Use a continuous, connected ground pour as the default GND conductor and reference. Use `plane({ net, layers, region: board() })` for a board-wide pour or `polygon(...)` for targeted copper. Do not pre-route ordinary GND connections with tracks or assign high priority to the whole net merely because it is ground.

Identify the actual nets from connectivity, including `/GND`, `VSS`, `AGND`, or `PGND` when present. Names are not interchangeable. Preserve intentional separate grounds and their defined connection points.

1. **Plan ground with critical circuits.** Choose the ground layers and space needed for return paths from the outset. Provide a specific critical return segment immediately when its current, timing, noise or local-loop geometry requires it, including necessary local return vias. This exception applies to that segment, not every connection on its ground net. Reserve a passage with a track only for a diagnosed need, not as a standard preliminary GND stage.
2. **Route ordinary circuits without ordinary GND tracks.** Use `ignoreNets(...)` with the actual ground-net names, or `onlyNets(...)` for the intended non-ground group. These selectors affect track-routing scope, not declared pours. Retain useful existing ground copper and any required early reference plane.
3. **Generate and verify the ground fill.** Rebuild pours and inspect actual connectivity of required pads and islands, reference continuity and narrow necks. Successfully creating a polygon does not prove that the required connection exists through its filled copper.
4. **Repair remaining ground connections.** First try correcting the local pour or adding necessary vias to useful ground copper. Use tracks where the pour cannot provide the required connection. Preserve valid filled copper and critical returns; after repair, rebuild affected pours and verify the whole requested scope again.

For example, after confirming that `GND` is the actual ordinary ground net and BOTTOM is the chosen pour layer, the full routing program can include:

```js
ignoreNets("GND");
plane({ net: "GND", layers: "BOTTOM", region: board() });
// Include the board's stack, DRC rules and signal/power routing intent.
runAll();
```

`ignoreNets("GND")` excludes the entire net from track routing, including critical branches; it does not isolate an ordinary subset. Handle a required critical ground segment explicitly before relying on this exclusion. Likewise, `onlyNets("GND")` selects the entire net, not one return branch. Use a precise [execute_js edit](../execution/instructions.md) when the DSL cannot express the required local connection. A later GND repair must follow inspected fill/connectivity evidence rather than blindly routing the entire net.

Choose repair-track geometry from the actual current and return-path requirements and effective DRC. A connection that remains the only conductor needs appropriate current capacity; do not apply a blanket minimum width. Narrow tracks and vias can establish connectivity without providing an adequate reference plane. Electrically connected islands still do not form a continuous reference on a split layer. If a required return corridor is blocked, diagnose the obstructing copper or placement and correct it within the authorized scope.

## Choose the ground-pour layers

Choose layers from the actual stack, signal reference needs, routing density, keepouts and component guidance. Explain the choice briefly; routine layer selection within the requested routing task does not need another approval.

- On a two-layer board, one relatively continuous ground layer can be the main reference. Add a pour on the other layer when it improves connections, return paths or shielding and can be connected usefully.
- `TOP`, `BOTTOM`, or `OUTER` can each be appropriate. `OUTER` means both external layers; it is the runtime default, not a requirement. Write `layers` explicitly so the choice is intentional.
- On a board with four or more layers, choose the reference layers from the stack. Do not pour every layer automatically.
- Respect antenna/RF copper exclusions, isolation gaps, and intentional ground partitions. Extra fill is useful only when its electrical role and connectivity are sound.

Example final pour for a board whose ground plan selects BOTTOM:

```js
plane({ net: "GND", layers: "BOTTOM", region: board() });
runCopper();
```

Use `runCopper()` when only copper generation is needed. Only after checking the rebuilt fill and trying appropriate pour/via corrections, use `onlyNets(...)` with the actual ground net and `runAll()` if the remaining connections require tracks; retain valid copper and include any required plane declarations. One `plane(...)` declaration is one logical zone; `zones: 1` does not identify how many physical layers were filled.

`onlyNets(...)` and `ignoreNets(...)` select routing scope, not the scope of copper declarations or deletion. Usually defer final GND pours and broad stitching until the relevant routes stabilize; retain or create earlier reference copper when the board needs it. For a new impedance reference, follow the [reference-plane guidance](#copper-layers-and-physical-assumptions). If existing zones or vias obstruct a later repair, use scoped cleanup for the diagnosed blockers.

## Board-wide GND stitching

Use stitching where it connects useful GND copper on different layers or provides a required return connection. Do not add a board-wide grid solely because the net is named GND. A broad grid is usually best added during final ground completion; add required return vias whenever the routing strategy needs them.

Choose positions and pitch from ground-island connectivity, return-current transitions, RF requirements and clearances. Place required local return vias near the relevant transitions even when a broad grid exists. The `pitchMm: 3` below is an illustrative grid spacing, not a universal electrical rule; the same reasoning applies to `plane(...).stitching.gridMm`.

```js
viaStitch("GND_GRID", {
  mode: "grid",
  net: "GND",
  region: board(),
  pitchMm: 3,
  via: "drc-min",
});
```

## Fanout is a retry

Do not call `fanout(...)` in the first routing attempt unless the user explicitly requires it. Let normal routing escape the package first. Add fanout only when the no-fanout result shows an escape problem at a dense QFN/QFP or specific pad.

Use the smallest target: prefer `pad(...)` when only some pads fail, and use `component(...)` only when the whole dense package needs the same escape policy. Prefer `method: "auto"`; request `underpad` directly only with a clear reason. A successful fanout is committed before main routing and can consume useful routing corridors.

Keep vias off pads unless the board explicitly requires via-in-pad. Plane stitching defaults to `viaInPad: false`. Inspect generated fanout and pad/via geometry; the default does not establish a universal geometric prohibition in every routing path.

## Describe electrical intent

Let the router derive geometry from the effective rules and declared physical assumptions:

- Use `powerNet("VBUS", { maxCurrentA: 2 })` instead of calculating track width. Add temperature rise, power pads, or tap constraints only when known.
- Use `priority: "critical"` on eligible `signalNet` or `powerNet` declarations when routing priority is needed for a critical circuit. Keep its semantic constraints too: priority does not replace `powerNet` current intent, `diffPair` coupling, impedance or `matchedGroup` length requirements. Use `high` for secondary preference within a stage and leave ordinary nets at `normal`.
- Use `viaPreference: "avoid"` for short or sensitive nets where a planar route is strongly preferred. `forbid` is a prohibitive routing preference, not a replacement for a fabrication/DRC rule.
- Use semantic impedance in `signalNet` or `diffPair` only with verified stack/reference information.
- Use `diffPair` for differential pairs and `matchedGroup` for independent nets that require matched lengths; see below.
- Use `drc(...)` and `netClass(...)` for real fabrication limits, not guessed geometry.

A logical high-speed or differential path may cross series resistors, AC-coupling capacitors, ferrite beads, or common-mode chokes and therefore use different physical net names on each side. Trace the complete logical path and apply the appropriate intent to every routed segment; a net-name boundary does not make the downstream segment ordinary. Do not extend the path through shunt or protection branches.

Use semantic intent to derive current and impedance geometry. Explicit dimensions, including ground repair widths, should come from the user, fabricator, pad geometry, or a verified requirement.

## Differential pairs and matched lengths

Declare a differential pair with `diffPair`: the two legs need adjacent, coupled routing as well as acceptable skew. Keep both legs in the same routing transaction. For example, after confirming these actual net names:

```js
onlyNets("USB_D+", "USB_D-");
diffPair("USB", { positive: "USB_D+", negative: "USB_D-" });
runAll();
```

Add `impedance`, `gapMm`, `maxSkewMm`, and `maxUncoupledLengthMm` from the actual interface requirements and physical stack. The example declares the pair relation; it does not establish an impedance target or sign off its geometry. Verify that both tracks follow the same corridor with suitable spacing, short uncoupled escapes, compatible transitions and a continuous reference.

Use `matchedGroup` for independent nets whose lengths must match, such as related bus signals. It constrains length without requiring adjacency: equally long routes can traverse opposite sides of the board. It cannot replace `diffPair`. When a differential path crosses series components, declare each physical pair segment and review the complete logical path.

## Existing DRC relations

Before changing existing net-class, differential-pair, or matched-length membership, call `get_pcb_drc_rules` once. It returns the compact authoritative relation state.

- `netClass`, `diffPair`, and `matchedGroup` upsert complete definitions and may replace membership.
- Use `assignNetsToNetClass`, `removeNetsFromNetClass`, or `unassignNetClass` for a targeted class edit.
- Use `addNetsToMatchedGroup`, `removeNetsFromMatchedGroup`, or `moveNetsToMatchedGroup` for a targeted matched-group edit.
- Use `deleteNetClass`, `deleteDiffPair`, or `deleteMatchedGroup` only when deletion is intended.

Do not reconstruct unrelated relations from memory or from a large PCB dump.

## Copper layers and physical assumptions

For a new or full routing transaction, declare the intended copper-layer structure with `stack(...)`. Resolve missing physical values instead of silently dropping stack-dependent intent:

1. Use the user's or fabricator's verified stack when available.
2. For an ordinary non-impedance prototype with no contrary evidence, a provisional `1.6 mm` FR-4 board and `1 oz` copper is a reasonable assumption. Declare it and report it to the user.
3. Ask for the fabricator stack when controlled impedance, flex construction, unusual thickness, inner-layer current capacity, or another requirement depends on dielectric or copper geometry.
4. Never omit `powerNet`, impedance, or another requested semantic method merely because stack data is missing. Either state a provisional stack or ask for the missing data.

Ordinary two-layer provisional example:

```js
stack({
  boardThicknessMm: 1.6,
  fallbackCopperThicknessOz: 1,
  layers: [
    { kind: "copper", name: "TOP" },
    { kind: "copper", name: "BOTTOM" },
  ],
});
```

EasyEDA accepts an even copper-layer count from 2 to 32. The routing transaction applies this count before validating routed layers. EasyEDA does not persist dielectric thickness, material, permittivity, copper thickness, or other full physical stack properties; it returns `EASYEDA_STACKUP_LAYER_COUNT_ONLY` when only the layer count is applied.

`fallbackCopperThicknessOz` is used for current-derived `powerNet` width when a layer has no explicit copper thickness. Impedance calculation requires usable copper and dielectric geometry, permittivity, and a reference plane; a board-thickness number alone is not enough. Report all provisional values and that only the copper-layer count is written to EasyEDA.

For the first controlled-impedance transaction, identify the reference plane before routing. The current compiler needs a solid imported reference or a `plane(...)` declaration as well as the physical stack; a reference-net name alone is insufficient. A declared plane is also generated after that transaction's routing, so it is not a planning-only statement. Retain the resulting zone when it supports the chosen routing strategy. If it blocks a necessary later route, temporarily remove the identified obstructing zone using scoped cleanup, preserve useful critical copper and rebuild the required pour afterward. Clearing a zone solely to follow the suggested stage order is unnecessary. Do not drop the impedance requirement to bypass missing reference data.

## Preserve and clear

Existing tracks, vias, and zones are fixed obstacles and are preserved by default. To replace existing copper, declare the exact scope in the same DSL:

```js
clearRouting({ nets: ["USB_D+", "USB_D-"], items: ["tracks", "vias"] });
```

Before repairing signals blocked by existing ground fill or stitching, inspect the affected ground copper and clear the obstructing object types in the repair transaction. For example, when both GND zones and vias can be regenerated:

```js
clearRouting({ nets: ["GND"], items: ["zones", "vias"] });
```

This selects **all zones and all vias on GND**, not only stitching vias. The selector has no stitching-only or local-region filter. Use `items: ["zones"]` when only pours obstruct the repair; include `vias` only after accounting for ordinary ground connections that must be rebuilt. Add `tracks` only when ground tracks also need replacement. Use the actual net names and preserve unrelated copper. If the net-wide selection would remove ground connections that must stay, use a precise [execute_js edit](../execution/instructions.md) of identified objects instead.

Keep deferred ground copper declarations out of the repair transaction so they do not immediately refill the cleared space. Retain passage-protecting GND tracks whenever possible. After signal repairs, rebuild removed ground connections, pours and stitching, then verify the complete board again.

Do not add `clearRouting({ nets: "all" })` by habit. A separate clear tool is not part of this workflow.

## Select one terminal

End every DSL file with exactly one terminal:

- `applyDrcRules()` for rules only;
- `applyStackup()` for copper-layer count only;
- `runCopper()` for selected polygons, planes, or stitching without KRT routing. `along` can follow retained existing tracks and `return` can use retained existing signal vias; if the required source routing does not exist, use `runRouting()` or `runAll()`;
- `runRouting()` for routing without applying DSL DRC changes;
- `runAll()` for the transaction's rules, layer count, copper, and routing intent.

## Run and verify

1. Open the target PCB and call `get_pcb_stack_layers` when current layers affect the decision.
2. For full-board routing, review complete connectivity once and classify every connected net; use targeted inspection for a partial operation. Confirm that the placement and intended layers provide plausible corridors and package escapes before starting the router.
3. Write the next DSL transaction for the chosen board-specific strategy and call `run_pcb_router_dsl({ file })`. Use the single-call or scoped strategy above, keeping ordinary ground connections pour-first and repairing them only after fill verification. Preserve useful copper and verify affected requirements as work advances.
4. If it returns `status: "running"`, call `wait_operation({ operation_id })` until terminal and use its progress to follow the attempt. Follow [operation results](../operations.md) for completion, cancellation, and application errors.
5. Apply [routing verification](verification.md) to the result. A useful `partial` result is already applied; diagnose its remaining work before choosing a repair.
6. Repair a concrete blocker using the procedure below, then recheck the affected scope. For full-board work, continue remaining groups and final ground completion. Stop at the requested boundary and report the verified result and unresolved findings.

## When routing does not converge

1. Identify the failing nets and location from diagnostics, progress, `inspect_net` and a focused `preview_pcb`. Distinguish an incomplete connection, a rule conflict, obstructing copper and a blocked package escape.
2. Correct the cause with a scoped DSL transaction. Preserve useful copper, include both legs of a pair and clear only diagnosed blockers. Keep actual fabrication and electrical limits.
3. Use [execute_js](../execution/instructions.md) when a precise native edit is clearly simpler or the DSL cannot express the needed repair. Examples include a local copper keepout or editing one identified obstructing object. Inspect native geometry and API semantics first; a placement exclusion is not a copper keepout. Rebuild affected pours and repeat [routing checks](verification.md) afterward.
4. If routing still cannot make progress, review the [placement](../pcb-layout/verification.md): component orientation, local density, pad escape and corridor width may be the cause. Identify the specific component or local block that needs moving. Revise it through the [placement workflow](../pcb-layout/instructions.md#iterative-local-corrections), including a focused script where appropriate, when the requested scope permits placement changes. For routing-only work, report the proposed layout change before expanding scope.

Continue targeted attempts while they produce measurable progress, such as fewer unconnected pads or blocking violations without breaking successful routes. Change the hypothesis or approach when the same failure repeats or fixes oscillate. There is no fixed attempt count; respect any user time budget and stop when requirements are met or no justified next correction remains. Report a remaining blocker with its net, location and required change.

The routing apply step uses one EasyEDA checkpoint recovery boundary and restores automatically on an application exception. A useful incomplete result remains applied, as does a successfully applied result with non-catastrophic DRC diagnostics, until the agent chooses to keep, repair, or restore it after verification. EasyEDA currently applies through vias and copper zones without holes.

Rely on the automatically created checkpoint; no separate pre-routing snapshot is needed. Retain the `checkpointId` returned by the applied routing result and use that exact ID if a manual restore is later required. Do not substitute a newer checkpoint created by subsequent inspection or repair work.

Ground-reference background: [TI, High-Speed Layout Guidelines (SCAA082A)](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/SCAA082A) explains why gaps in a reference plane disrupt signal return paths. Evaluate the final reference copper even when ground connectivity checks pass.


## Layers reserved for planes

On boards with up to four copper layers, Hybrid runs EasyEDA WASM first and KRT afterward for unfinished connections and special constraints. Above four copper layers, KRT runs first. The threshold counts physical copper layers, including layers reserved for planes.

Set `disableRouting: true` on a copper entry in `stack.layers` to forbid new tracks on that layer for every net. For example, a copper entry in a complete four-layer stack can be:

```js
{ kind: "copper", name: "INNER_1", thicknessOz: 1, disableRouting: true }
```

Keep the other copper and dielectric entries in their physical order with the actual board parameters. Do not copy a guessed stack merely to disable a layer. Omitted `disableRouting` means false. Declare the policy in each routing program that needs it; it is not a persistent EasyEDA editor setting.

The layer remains available for planes, impedance reference calculations and through-via spans. Existing tracks are not cleared by this declaration. Per-net `allowedLayers` can narrow the enabled set but cannot re-enable a disabled layer; an empty intersection for a routed net is rejected before routing. WASM and KRT receive the filtered routing layers, including fallback and repair passes. Returned copper is checked for new tracks on disabled layers. This does not prohibit via barrels or via annular rings on a plane layer.
