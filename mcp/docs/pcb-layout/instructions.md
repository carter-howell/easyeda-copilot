# PCB placement

`make_pcb_layout` creates placement and mechanics only. It returns a preview and stored `layoutId`; it does not apply the result or authorize routing.

Read `dsl.ts` as the exact syntax source. The files in `examples/` are patterns, not authority. They use the same order: board and global rules, functional blocks, components and mechanics, electrical placement intent, then output and solver. Read any examples that help, but derive designators, dimensions, pin numbers, and constraints from the actual board.

## Start

1. Resolve the BOARD, linked schematic, and target PCB with `get_current_project_info`.
2. If schematic changes must be imported, open the target PCB, call `import_pcb_changes`, then **stop and ask the user to confirm the EasyEDA import dialog**. Continue only after confirmation.
3. Inspect [schematic groups](../schematic/groups.md). For a new or full placement, call `get_schematic_groups({ get_full_schematic_groups: true })`, then call `get_schematic({ get_full_schematic: true })` once for complete connectivity. For a scoped placement, open an affected schematic page and use the default current-page mode with only the schematic context needed for that scope. Reuse fresh results already in context.
4. Open the target PCB before `make_pcb_layout`. The MCP captures its outline and linked schematic-component positions as `existingPlacement`.
5. Call `get_pcb_component_sizes` once for the required designators. Use `includeAll: true` only when sizing or validating the board genuinely requires every component; its output is much larger.
6. Select one preservation mode before writing DSL.

| Intent                                            | DSL                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New PCB or full re-placement                      | do not call `preserve`                                          |
| Keep current outline; re-place components         | `preserve({ board: true })`                                     |
| Add/place new components; keep existing placement | `preserve({ board: true, components: "all" })`                  |
| Move selected existing components                 | preserve an explicit list of every component that must not move |

`components: "all"` preserves current schematic components whose centers are inside the board outline. Explicitly list an outside-board component that must stay fixed. Do not use `"all"` when an existing component must move.

Every placement DSL for an existing PCB must contain one `preserve(...)` declaration matching the selected mode. Keep it in the complete DSL used for mechanical preview, final placement, and any later placement repair. Omit it only for an intentional new-board or full re-placement result.

## Electrical and routing preflight

Placement and routing are one coupled physical problem. Do not write placement DSL until the component-to-net topology has been reviewed and there is a plausible way to route the proposed placement. Routing cannot rescue a placement that blocks its only signal, power, return, escape, or thermal paths.

1. Use `maybe_blocks` as fast provisional functional groups, not as ready-made DSL blocks. Use `wires` to identify direct local relationships, especially a bypass or support passive connected to a specific IC supply pin. Resolve multipart block references to their physical designators before writing DSL.
2. Confirm those candidates against the complete connectivity returned by `get_schematic`, including component values and pin functions. If that context is unavailable, use one `get_current_pcb` snapshot after import and reopen the relevant schematic page only when an omitted ground relationship or ambiguous group needs confirmation. Missing group or wire output does not prove that components are unrelated. Do not call `inspect_net` for every net.
3. Trace logical paths through series resistors, AC-coupling capacitors, ferrite beads, common-mode chokes, zero-ohm links, and matching networks. A net-name boundary at a series component does not end the logical signal. Continue only through its series channel; do not treat a shunt capacitor or ESD branch as path continuation.
4. Review every component and connected net. Classify mechanics, critical signal paths, power paths and current loops, thermal candidates, and ordinary connectivity. Ordinary nets need no DSL constraint, but they still count as reviewed.
5. Choose a provisional routing strategy before density: intended copper-layer roles, reference/return planes, supported via technology, dense-package escape directions, and which layers may pass under components. Plan space for ground pours and critical return paths; ordinary GND tracks are repairs for connections the verified fill cannot provide, not a default early routing stage. Follow the [routing strategy](../pcb-routing/instructions.md#plan-globally-route-in-manageable-transactions), adapting it to the board's topology, layers and existing copper. This is planning only; placement does not authorize changing stackup or routing.
6. Reserve continuous capacity for each important flow: both legs and every series segment of a differential pair, RF/clock paths, high-current copper, switch/decoupling loops, return paths, connector escapes, via fields, and thermal spreading. Keep critical loops short without packing them so tightly that their required copper cannot fit.
7. Then choose board size, density, component sides, rotations, blocks, and constraints. Split or merge provisional schematic groups when physical placement, mechanics, thermal needs, or routing corridors require it. High density and `compactness: "high"` are valid for a topology and layer/via strategy that can support them; low density alone does not guarantee routability.

For each power IC, regulator, MOSFET, driver, high-power LED/resistor, and exposed pad, explicitly decide whether it needs `primitive.thermalPad(...)`, external copper/via space to be implemented during routing, or no thermal action. Base the decision on the datasheet and credible dissipation assumptions; do not silently omit the thermal review.

Use the topology analysis selectively. Any known ordered path that is substantially more important than ordinary connectivity may justify `signalPath`; one isolated dominant hop may justify `criticalPair`. The path can be RF, analog, clock, differential-leg, or a board-spanning priority signal. Do not convert every reviewed connection into a placement constraint.

## Run

1. Define the board, holes, blocks, components, and only preflight-justified constraints in one complete placement DSL file.
2. If mechanics changed, read `mechanical-validation.md` and run a focused mechanical preview with `solver({ preview: true, placeOnlyComponents: [...] })`.
3. Call `make_pcb_layout({ file })`. If it returns `status: "running"`, follow [operations.md](../operations.md) and wait until terminal.
4. If this is a mechanical preview, inspect it with `mechanical-validation.md`, correct obvious in-scope defects, and obtain mechanical approval. Then remove the preview filters and run the complete DSL. A mechanical preview is never assembled.
5. Evaluate the completed full placement using [placement verification](verification.md). Read diagnostics and view `previewImagePath` or render `previewSvgPath`. Correct concrete defects using the iteration loop below.
6. Show the final preview and obtain placement approval unless the user already explicitly authorized applying this placement without another review. Reuse an approval for the same unchanged final result; mechanical approval alone does not approve unreviewed full placement.
7. Keep the target PCB open and call `assemble_pcb_layout_on_current_pcbdoc({ layoutId })` with that completed final `layoutId`.
8. Verify the live placement with the same [stage checks](verification.md) and make necessary focused corrections as described below. Stop at the placement boundary unless routing was requested.

Assembly preserves existing copper and board objects. It replaces the existing outline only when the placement result contains a new valid outline. The solver receives existing outline and schematic-component positions, but not every copper or mechanical primitive; check an incrementally changed routed board after assembly.

## Iterative local corrections

Fix clear defects within the requested placement task without asking the user to micromanage each move. Examples: bring a decoupling capacitor to the correct supply pad, rotate a passive to shorten its connection, or rearrange a local block to reopen a ground passage. Preserve unrelated placement and approved mechanics.

1. Identify the defect from diagnostics, connected pads and an inspected preview. Record affected designators, current poses, relevant neighbors and the expected improvement: a shorter current loop, better pin access, fewer overlaps or an open routing passage.
2. Refine the complete DSL with the correct preservation scope, or use a suitable `refineGroup`. Use [execute_js](../execution/instructions.md) for a known component move, rotation or local block arrangement when the DSL cannot express it, attempts have stalled, or the direct edit is clearly simpler. Read the exact native API and current object IDs/poses first.
3. Apply one coherent batch, then reread affected poses and view the result. Compare the original finding and preservation boundary. On a routed board, run current native DRC because moving components can leave existing copper behind.
4. Continue while each pass provides measurable improvement without creating a more serious defect. Ten targeted passes can be justified; there is no fixed attempt count. Stop when requirements are met or no justified improvement remains, and respect any user time budget. If the same failure repeats or parts oscillate between poses, change the approach or revisit the local layout plan.

A need to move whole functional sections, resize the board, change the stack or disturb approved mechanics calls for revising the plan. Identify the exact blocker and revise within the authorized scope; obtain a changed mechanical requirement when needed. If a blocking defect remains, do not call placement complete. Warnings matter when they reveal a real functional or requested visual improvement; clearing every warning is not the objective.

Do not reassemble an older `layoutId` after live corrections: it can overwrite them. Treat the verified live PCB as the current result and retain its checkpoint/pose record. Follow [recovery](../recovery.md) when a correction regresses the board.

## Placement structure

- Every new or movable real component belongs to exactly one explicit block. A component protected by `preserve({ components: ... })` may be omitted; the runtime gives otherwise unowned preserved components a system block.
- A block is one physical island and normally shares a non-GND net. Use `allowDisconnected: true` only for intentional mechanical or same-role groups. It permits disconnected topology but adds no spatial attachment. A movable passive-only block should be a satellite with `placement: "satellite"`, `attachTo`, and preferably `anchor: pin(...)`, or have an external `near`, `veryNear`, or `criticalPair` through concrete `comp()`/`pin()` targets.
- Keep blocks below 12 components. Split dense functions into local power, clock, flash, feedback, input, output, or interface islands.
- Keep an IC with the local parts that make its stage work; do not group by component type.
- Do not mix top and bottom components in one block.
- A block containing `fixed`, `edgeMount`, or `edgePlace` components must be board-level/main. It cannot use `placement: "satellite"` or `attachTo`; relate its electronics to other blocks with `near`, `veryNear`, or `criticalPair`.
- If any component in a block uses `edgePlace()`, every component in that block must also use `edgePlace()`. Multiple `edgePlace()` components may share a block. Put ordinary support components in separate compact blocks and connect them with `near()`, `veryNear()`, or `criticalPair()`. Mixed blocks are rejected with the block name and affected designators.
- Mechanical groups nested in modules are dissolved recursively so each `edgePlace()` component keeps its own edge requirements. Constraints must not reference a group that is dissolved for board placement: use `comp("designator")` or `pin("designator", "pin_number")` instead of `block("name")`. Such group references are rejected instead of silently ignored.
- Use modules as soft macro groups; do not put distant edge connectors into one sparse module.
- Do not repeat a satellite in a module that already contains its parent block; the parent family already owns that satellite.
- Use `criticalPair` for one isolated dominant pad-to-pad hop that is not part of a longer declared path.
- Use `corePairs` for several independent dominant pairs inside one block, not for the consecutive segments of a signal chain.
- Use `signalPath` for any known ordered electrical path whose physical implementation is much more important than ordinary connectivity. It is not limited to RF or high-speed nets: use it for analog measurement and trigger chains, clocks, each ordered leg of a differential path, long board-spanning priority signals, and series matching/filtering/termination chains when their component order and routable geometry matter.
- Do not use `signalPath` for ordinary low-priority connectivity, a single isolated hop, or every connection on the board. It is self-contained: do not repeat its segments with `criticalPair` or `corePairs`, because overlapping attraction rules can over-constrain the placer. It guides placement only; differential-pair, routing, return-path, and impedance intent remain separate.
- Use `capCluster` for two or more capacitors sharing supply and return; use `bypass`, `veryNear`, or `criticalPair` for a single capacitor.
- Use `fixed` only for a true mechanical coordinate.
- `fixed()` is generally not recommended for passive R/C/L components or local support parts because it blocks electrical placement optimization. The report emits one aggregate warning rather than listing every passive designator. Keep a passive fixed only when it has a real mechanical requirement.
- Use `constraintRegion` for placement exclusion; it is not a copper keepout.

Current examples:

- `examples/esp32c3-devboard.js`: edge mechanics, power clusters, both USB differential legs continued across protection and series resistors, and a diagnostic-justified refinement group.
- `examples/rf-amplifier.js`: a straight critical RF path between edge-mounted connectors and a separate power section.
- `examples/analog-trigger-pwm.js`: an analog input/buffer/comparator trigger path plus a separate PWM-derived threshold path, with local feedback and bypass placement.

Example for one critical RF chain:

```js
signalPath("RF_ANT", [
  [pin("J1", "1"), pin("L1", "1")],
  [pin("L1", "2"), pin("C1", "1")],
  [pin("C1", "2"), pin("U1", "ANT")],
]);
```

## Post-placement refinement

The solver already applies safe 180-degree rotations and swaps for eligible movable components within their block. Do not add `refineGroup` by default.

Use `refineGroup` when a `post_place_opportunity` diagnostic reports a safe improvement blocked only by fixed/preserved placement, or when named equivalent fixed/preserved components are intentionally allowed to exchange their final poses or rotate 180 degrees. The diagnostic explains that the candidate was not applied because fixed mechanics must be preserved. `refineGroup` is explicit permission for that final polish, not a placement command: it creates no coordinates, does not replace blocks or constraints, and may accept no move.

```js
refineGroup("headers", ["H1", "H2"], { swap: true, rotateBy: [180] });
```

- `swap: true` requires at least two pose-compatible components: the same part, footprint, or equivalent footprint geometry.
- `rotateBy` supports only `[180]` and is relative to the resolved pose. The component must also allow that final rotation.
- Give every group a unique non-empty name. Components cannot appear in multiple refinement groups. Enable `swap`, `rotateBy`, or both.
- Listing a fixed or preserved component explicitly permits its pose to change. Do not list anything whose exact pose or designator-to-position mapping must remain fixed.
- Do not use `refineGroup` for `edgeMount`, `edgePlace`, or synthetic `boardPad` components; they are not refinable.
- A swap moves component identity and pinout to the other resolved pose. For connectors and other mechanical parts, use it only when the parts are truly interchangeable, then inspect orientation and access in the preview.
- A run that accepts no refinement move is valid. Do not keep adding constraints merely to force a move.

## Starting values

Use `board.auto(...)` unless dimensions are mechanically fixed. For an ordinary board without stronger topology evidence, useful starting values are density `0.4`, component clearance `0.25-0.5 mm`, and grid `0.5` or `1 mm`. Footprint geometry, mechanics, and routing feasibility take priority.

`clearance` includes body and silkscreen bounds and defaults to `0.35 mm`. For `capCluster`, a starting gap of `0.25-0.4 mm` is usually appropriate. Choose compactness from the topology and intended routing technology, not from a blanket preference for sparse or dense placement.

## Result handling

Apply only a reviewed final placement within the user's authorization. Use [placement verification](verification.md) to evaluate the actual board, make justified local corrections and report the areas checked, improvements and unresolved findings. Follow [recovery](../recovery.md) when the result cannot be kept or repaired safely.
